# Statement: In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

# Hint: Pythonâ€™s default arguments are evaluated once when the function is defined,
# not each time the function is called (like it is in say, Ruby).
# This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it,
# you will and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as well.
